This is a simple let's say forum or chat application written in vanilla python.
I created this for people who are bored at school so you and other people in your class or school idk can chat together undisturbed pretty easily.

You can host servers over the local network and join servers other has setup XD

HOW TO USE:
When somebody presses "1" on their keyboard you'll be given the host option. Then you need to enter the port to host your local server on, I personally recommend port 5000.
The person who hosted the server will get a key that is setup like this: 127.0.0.1:5000. (Of course it will be your ip address and the port you chose for other people to connect too.)
When somebody presses "2" on their keyboard they will be given the join option. Which says "Enter server key". Enter the server key and you're gonna be joining the local server somebody setup.

ENJOY ! (Sorry for bad english)
